1. You can open issues
2. You can create pull requests

 ### How to make a clean pull request
 
  
 - Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
 - Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
 - Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
 - If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
 - Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `develop` if it exists, else from `master`.
 - Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
 - Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
 - If the project has tests run them!
 - Write or adapt tests as needed.
 - Add or change the documentation as needed.
 - Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.
 - Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
 - From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `develop` branch if there is one, else go for `master`!
 - ...
 - Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
 your extra branch(es).
 
 And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
